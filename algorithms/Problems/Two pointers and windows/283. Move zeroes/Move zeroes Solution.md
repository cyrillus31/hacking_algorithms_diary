>[!Note]- Problem Description
/*
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
> Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
> 
>  
> 
> Example 1:
> 
> Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
> Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
> 
> Example 2:
> 
> Input: nums = [0]
> Output: [0]
> 
>  
> 
> Constraints:
> 
>     1 <= nums.length <= 104
>     -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
> 
>  
> Follow up: Could you minimize the total number of operations done?
