#### When to use binary search?
We can use binary search when we can divide the array into 'bad' and 'good' values. 
Result of binary search is always TWO pointers.

`m = l + (r - l)/2 = (r + l) / 2`


You can compare which number is closer to some other constanta is by using modulo operator:
13 % 10 = 3

9 % 10 = 9
