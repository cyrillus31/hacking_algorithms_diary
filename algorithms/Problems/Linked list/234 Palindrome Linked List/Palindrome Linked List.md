Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a
palindrome
or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false

 

Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
    0 <= Node.val <= 9

 
Follow up: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?
