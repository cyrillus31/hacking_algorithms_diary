>[!Note]- Problem Description
>/*
> Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.
> Example 1:
> 
> Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
> Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
> Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
> After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
> 
> Example 2:
> 
> Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
> Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
> 
> 
> My test  case:
> Input: nums = [1] 
> Output: 1
> Input: nums = [-9, -10]
> Output: [81, 100]
> Input: nums = [0, 0, 0]
> Output: [0, 0, 0]
> 
> Constraints:
> 
>     1 <= nums.length <= 104
>     -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
>     nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
> 
>  
> Follow up: Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?
