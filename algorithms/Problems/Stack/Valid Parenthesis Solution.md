Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"

Output: true

Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"

Output: false

Example 4:

Input: s = "([])"

Output: true

 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

My input: '(){[}]'
My output: 'false'

## Solution Idea
___
USE STACK

## Special Test Cases
___
```
"["
"]"
```

## Time Complexity
___
**O(n)** 
Because we do some action on every element in the input array.

## Space Complexity
___
**O(n)**
Because at worst we will put all elements on the stack and that's it.

## My Code:
___
```go
