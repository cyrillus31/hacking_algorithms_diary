Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 < nums[i], target < 104
All the integers in nums are unique.
nums is sorted in ascending order.


## Solution Idea
___
Divide our array into two parts. One which suffices a condition `<= target` and the other that doesn't. Pick a left pointer inside the array. Pick a right pointer outside the array so that a left pointer can potentially find the result.
Pick a middle index. If the element in middle index satisfies the condition - move left pointer.
